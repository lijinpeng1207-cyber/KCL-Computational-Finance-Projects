Stochastic Pricing Engine & Multi-Asset Modeling (KCL)

Implemented a high-fidelity simulation engine for correlated assets using Cholesky Decomposition and Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM).

Developed a cross-validation framework for European and American options using Black-Scholes, Monte Carlo, and Binomial Tree methods.

Conducted convergence analysis and validated market consistency via Put-Call Parity checks.

Optimized numerical stability for pricing formulas, achieving 100% accuracy against benchmark analytical solutions.
